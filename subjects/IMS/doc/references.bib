    abstract = "{There has been renewed interest in the issue of growing trees to sequester carbon following the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. It is a complex issue, raising many questions. In this paper, the author offers answers to some of the questions commonly asked in the UK. These questions concern: (1) the basic rationale for growing trees to sequester carbon (does it make sense?); (2) the size of the reservoirs, sinks and sources of carbon in the UK (how important are the forests?); (3) effects of species, site and management (which is most effective at storing carbon?), (4) areas and numbers of trees needed to offset fossil fuel emissions (how many trees need to be planted per person or per car?); and (5) the monetary value of the carbon stored (what is it worth?). The answers given are taken mostly from published literature.}",
